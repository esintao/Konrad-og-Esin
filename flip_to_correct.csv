Each cell part has a function that helps the cell survive and grow.
Some cell parts are called organelles. Organelles are cell structures that are surrounded by their own membranes. Here are some of the organelles in animal cells:
Mitochondria help the cell get the energy it needs. Mitochondria break down sugar and release energy that the cell can use for all of its activities.
The nucleus directs cell activities by sending instructions to different parts of the cell. The nucleus contains structures called chromosomes. The chromosomes are made mostly of hereditary material called DNA. DNA contains information that the cell uses for growth and activities. These instructions tell ribosomes how to build molecules called proteins, which make up cell structures and help chemical reactions happen in the cell.
The endoplasmic reticulum is an organelle that helps ribosomes build proteins. The nucleus sends instructions for making proteins to ribosomes. Ribosomes can attach to the endoplamic reticulum. The endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes use these instructions to make proteins that the cell needs to survive and grow.
After proteins are made in the endoplasmic reticulum, they can be transferred to the Golgi. The Golgi is an organelle made up of flat, stacked membranes. The Golgi sorts and packages proteins and other substances. Then, the Golgi sends these substances to different parts of the cell. Some of these substances are sent to the cell membrane and released from the cell.
Animal cells also have organelles for storage and waste removal. The vacuoles store sugar and other nutrients. The lysosomes break down worn-out cell parts and other waste. Animal cells usually have several vacuoles and lysosomes.
Other cell parts are not surrounded by their own membranes. These cell parts are not organelles.
The cell membrane is a thin layer that surrounds and protects the cell. This layer is a membrane, but it does not have a membrane surrounding it, so it is not an organelle. The cell membrane controls which substances enter and leave the cell.
The cytoplasm is a thick liquid that fills the space inside the cell. The cytoplasm also helps the cell keep its shape and supports the other cell parts.",The endoplasmic reticulum helps the cell make proteins. Instructions for making proteins are sent to ribosomes. Ribosomes can attach to the endoplamic reticulum and use the instructions to make proteins.,endoplasmic ,0,,B,Reasoning:Endoplasmic reticulum helps an animal cell make proteins.
