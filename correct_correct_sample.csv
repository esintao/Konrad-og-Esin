baking an apple pie
rust forming on a metal gate","['Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are caused by heating.', 'Both are caused by cooling.']",1,,closed choice,grade3,natural science,chemistry,Correct–Correct,Compare physical and chemical changes,"Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.","Step 1: Think about each change.
Baking an apple pie is a chemical change. The type of matter in the pie changes. The apples become soft, and the crust turns brown.
Rust forming on a metal gate is a chemical change. As the gate rusts, the metal turns into a different type of matter called rust. Rust is reddish-brown and falls apart easily.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Baking is caused by heating. But rust forming on a metal gate is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.",(B),1,B,B,Reasoning:Baking an apple pie rust forms on a metal gate. The final answer: (B).,Baking an apple pie rust forms on a metal gate.,B,1

Living things are called organisms.
Plants come in many shapes and sizes. Most plants grow in the ground. They might grow leaves, flowers, and fruit. Plants cannot move around on their own like animals can.
Animals also come in many shapes and sizes. Most animals can move around. Animals might run, swim, jump, or fly. Animals eat plants or other organisms for food.","Aloe vera is a plant. It has spiny leaves.
Aloe vera leaves contain a watery liquid. People use this liquid in lotion and medicine.
A mango tree is a plant. It has many green leaves.
Mango trees can grow to over 100 feet tall!
A hummingbird is an animal. It walks and flies.
A hummingbird can fly backwards and upside-down!
A giant water lily is a plant. It can grow big flowers.
Giant water lilies grow in the Amazon river in South America.",B,1,B,B,Reasoning:Hummingbirds walk and fly. Hummingbirds have spiny leaves. The final answer: (B).,Hummingbirds walk and fly. Hummingbirds have spiny leaves.,B,1
