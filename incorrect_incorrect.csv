Each cell part has a function that helps the cell survive and grow.
Some cell parts are called organelles. Organelles are cell structures that are surrounded by their own membranes. Here are some of the organelles in plant cells:
Chloroplasts and mitochondria work together to help the cell get the energy it needs. The chloroplasts use photosynthesis to make sugar. The mitochondria break down this sugar and release energy that the cell can use for all of its activities.
The nucleus directs cell activities by sending instructions to different parts of the cell. The nucleus contains structures called chromosomes. The chromosomes are made mostly of hereditary material called DNA. DNA contains information that the cell uses for growth and activities. These instructions tell ribosomes how to build molecules called proteins, which make up cell structures and help chemical reactions happen in the cell.
The endoplasmic reticulum is an organelle that helps ribosomes build proteins. The nucleus sends instructions for making proteins to ribosomes. Ribosomes can attach to the endoplamic reticulum. The endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes use these instructions to make proteins that the cell needs to survive and grow.
After proteins are made in the endoplasmic reticulum, they can be transferred to the Golgi. The Golgi is an organelle made up of flat, stacked membranes. The Golgi sorts and packages proteins and other substances. Then, the Golgi sends these substances to different parts of the cell. Some of these substances are sent to the cell membrane and released from the cell.
In plant cells, the vacuole stores waste, water, and nutrients such as sugar. Most plant cells have one vacuole.
Other cell parts are not surrounded by their own membranes. These cell parts are not organelles.
The cell wall is the cell's tough outer covering. It gives the cell strength and stiffness and helps the cell keep its shape.
On the inside of the cell wall is a thin layer called the cell membrane. This layer is a membrane, but it does not have a membrane surrounding it, so it is not an organelle. The cell membrane controls which substances enter and leave the cell.

The results of these experiments suggest that searching the Internet may cause a systematic failure to recognize the extent to which we rely on outsourced knowledge. Searching for explanations on the Internet inflates self-assessed knowledge in unrelated domains.
If you use a direct quotation in your writing, you must use quotation marks around the exact words that were copied from the source, in addition to citing the source.
Researchers have found that relying on the Internet for information may cause a systematic failure to recognize the extent to which we rely on outsourced knowledge.
This sentence is plagiarized because it uses the source's exact words without quotation marks and without properly citing the source.
Researchers have found that relying on the Internet for information ""may cause a systematic failure to recognize the extent to which we rely on outsourced knowledge"" (Fisher, Goddu, and Keil).
If you paraphrase a source, or put a source's ideas into your own words, you must still cite the source. Even if properly cited, a paraphrase that is too similar to the source in wording or sentence structure is still considered plagiarized.
According to Fisher, Goddu, and Keil, searching the Internet can lead to a regular failure to perceive the extent to which we rely on outside knowledge.
This sentence is plagiarized because it is an insufficient paraphrase. Even though it is properly cited, it borrows too much of the source's wording and sentence structure.
According to Fisher, Goddu, and Keil, relying on the Internet to look up information can make it difficult for us to estimate how much of our knowledge comes from internal versus external sources.
